2017 Digital World Project with Simpy
To simulate heat flow in an algae bottle by natural processes

1. 2D Simpy Algae Water Pump is to simulate the heat flow in an algae bottle by 3 processes, 
namely convection to the air, radiation by the sun and conduction to the water pump
2. 2D Temperature Sensor and Water Pump is to interface the temperature sensor and motor pump to
Raspberry Pi
